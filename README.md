## Usage and Limitations
To ensure the `FocusComponents` extension works correctly, it is important to place components within vertical or horizontal organizations. This structuring is crucial for accurate positioning and highlighting of components, as the extension calculates coordinates based on the parent container's layout. Failure to do so may result in imprecise focus alignment or unexpected behaviors.

In conclusion, the `FocusComponents` extension is an innovative tool for creating interactive and educational Android applications. Its ability to guide users' attention through focused components and explanatory texts makes it invaluable for tutorial and instructional app development.
